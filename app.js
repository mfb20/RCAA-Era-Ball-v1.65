// PLAYER CARD EDITOR — v1.6 (card system carried forward from v1.052)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every historical player VERSION has its own exact entry below.
// To add/change an image, put the image file in ./images/players/ and paste the
// path into `image`. To change that version's biography, edit `bio`.
//
// Example:
// "17-ice-rac": {
//   image: "./images/players/rac-s17.png",
//   bio: "Write Season 17 Rac's unique bio here."
// },
//
// Leaving image as "" shows the initials fallback. No other code needs editing.
